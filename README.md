# Horreum

A lightweight solution for storing miscellaneous data.

## Background

A Horreum was a storehouse for storing foodstuffs, clothing, wine, and even marble in ancient Rome. This software is similar in that it provides a simple way to store random and miscellaneous data in a lightweight, easy-to-use, and easy-to-maintain form.

### Disclaimer

Horreum is **not** meant to replace a production database, and is intended as a way to store non-essential data for small prototype or toy projects. If you need a "schema-less" storage solution for a production product, go use [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
